# Kenneth portfolio
For my portfolio project in the Google Cybersecurity certification

Strengths: 

// I have the urge to continously learn to stay updated with everything that is going on in the world.

// I have the discipline to continue going even without the motivation or end goal in place.

// I am currently trying to learn everyday and expand my langauges in programming (currently proficient in C# and Python).

Values:

// Adhereing to the law and following guidelines I tend to be a person to follow the rules word by word.

// I put 110% effort in things I enjoy and are passionate about such as the process of a better health and lifestyle, cognitive thinking, learning things related to software developments, cybersecuirty, and AI!

Clarifying questions:

// What interest me the most is being able to protect people online while they use the internet. What got me to want to do this is due to my family memebers and friends falling victim to cyber scams as well as attacks and I want to be there to help protect them and do my best to avoid these situations to ever happen again. I also love how in this field we have to constantly be learning new things to stay updated I enjoy the process of learning new things and being updated in this field. But to be more exact I'd like to work in both teams of red and blue team from time to time as I find both to be interesting.

// The audience for my professional statement would be cybersecurity recruiters, mentors, job employeers, and anyone who would just like to know me a bit more.

// I think my strength and values will help me continue through the path of cybersecurity for the long term as I really enjoy the learning process and having to constantly be updated and learn the newest things that are surronding this field. As well as the aspect of having a hands on approach of learning and using AI tools seems like a blast to me.
